# This file is part of the UTILITIES package.

# TASK: You are tasked with creating a Bash script to control the PTZ
# (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) functionality of IP cameras on a local network. The
# script should allow users to select a camera from a list, send PTZ
# commands to the selected camera, and handle errors
# gracefully. Additionally, provide a user-friendly interface for
# selecting the camera and controlling its PTZ functionality. Ensure
# proper handling of PTZ commands and detection of camera IP addresses
# based on MAC addresses.

# Ensure no command line arguments are provided
if [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; then
